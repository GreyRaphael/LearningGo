## Context with timeout webservice

Target: calls three web services, send data to two of those services, and then take the results of those two calls and send them to the third, returning the result. The entire process must take less than 50 milliseconds, or an error is returned.

> When there’s a context available, use its timer support rather than calling `time.After`. One of the advantages of using the context’s timer is that it allows us to respect timeouts that are set by the functions that called this function.

- [recommended implementation](ch08/example01.go)
- [simplified implementation](ch08/example02.go), If you trust `callWebServiceC`, Since the context is passed into `callWebServiceC`, the function can be written to respect the timeout and return an error if it was triggered. 
- [simple implementation](ch08/example03.go) by `time.After`, 将`callWebServiceA+callWebServiceB`和`callWebServiceC`两个过程的timeout分开了
